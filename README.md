This is the supplementary file for the paper "Towards privacy at scale: A Comprehensive Synthetic Tabular Data Generation and Evaluation in Learning Analytics".

The file will provide mathematical definitions for resemblance, utility, and privacy metrics.

# Resemblance

1. Difference in pairwise correlation
2. Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)
3. Wasserstein distance (WD)


# Utility
1. machine learning utility evaluation


# Privacy
1. Distance to Closest Record (DCR)
2. Nearest Neighbour Distance Ratio (NNDR)
3. Membership interface attack (MIA)
